# Project Description
ALSET aims to decentralise delivery between nodes within the supply chain by providing a platform for businesses and individuals to post and accept delivery requests, while at the same time providing greater protection to the users of the platform having a central pool of money for the betterment of the users by insuring the dispatchers.

# Problem it solves:
-	Transparency issues in delivery pricing, arising from the monopolistic nature of the industry
-	Lack of traceability of delivery (status and locality)
-	Under insured dispatchers who are normally from the B40

# How it works:
-	Through the use of blockchain, a platform for delivery services for businesses and individuals is created in which users can post and accept delivery jobs: businesses/individuals post a delivery job with x amount of tokens as rewards; dispatchers can choose jobs based on rewards, locality, and convenience. ALSET tokens are also used as escrow in a delivery job to ensure that high value parcels are delivered safely.
-	Dispatchers can choose multiple jobs, in which ALSET’s route optimisation feature will determine the most efficient route for dispatchers to complete the jobs. 
-	Using advanced machine learning methods, the system can aggregate and split jobs to optimize the delivery. For example, 5 different jobs from the same pickup location to the same dropoff location can be aggregated as a single job automatically by the system.
-	A portion of the rewards will be deposited into a common insurance pool under a copayment system – both the business senders and dispatchers will contribute to the pool.
-	During an insurance claim by a dispatcher, ALSET will verify the insurance claim by obtaining information from digital ID/medical insurance claim system before dispensing the compensation to the dispatcher. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is used to ease the processing of claim related document to facilitate and shorten the claim process duration.
-	We monitor the driving behaviour of dispatcher through IOT data connected from mobile apps installed in dispatcher’s phone. We use machine learning method to come up with a safety driving score which will indicate how much claim amount of a particular dispatcher can claim in an accident.
